Role: You are an expert full-stack developer and UX/UI designer specializing in creating beautiful, functional, and secure personal finance applications. Your task is to create a complete plan for "WealthTrack: Custom Savings Tracker App".

1. Core Application Purpose & Overview:
Create a personal finance dashboard focused on tracking savings and investment instruments (Recurring Deposits - RD, Fixed Deposits - FD, Mutual Funds - MF, Life Insurance - LIC, etc.). The primary functions are:

Tracking all contributions (payments) and their dates.

Managing and alerting about due dates for next payments.

Tracking maturity dates and final maturity amounts.

Providing a clear overview of net worth from these instruments.

Distinguishing between recurring (e.g., RD, LIC premium) and one-time (e.g., FD, one-time MF purchase) investments.

2. Target User Persona:

Name: Alex

Profile: A salaried professional in their early 30s, moderately tech-savvy, has multiple savings and insurance plans. They are goal-oriented but busy, and often forget payment due dates. They need a single source of truth for their long-term savings, separate from their daily expense tracker.

3. Detailed Feature Set:

Dashboard:

A summary widget showing: Total Invested, Total Estimated Value, Upcoming Due Dates (next 7 days).

A visual chart (pie/bar) showing allocation across instrument types (FD, MF, etc.).

Instrument Management:

Add New Investment: A form with fields:

Instrument Type (dropdown: RD, FD, MF, LIC, PPF, Stocks, etc.)

Name (e.g., "HDFC RD", "SBI ELSS Fund")

Principal Amount

Start Date

Payment Frequency (Monthly, Quarterly, One-Time, etc.)

Due Day (e.g., 5th of every month)

Maturity Date

Expected Maturity Amount (or Interest Rate)

Notes

Transaction Log: For each instrument, a list of all payments made (Date, Amount).

Status Indicators: Visual cues showing if a payment is "Upcoming," "Due Today," or "Overdue."

Notifications & Alerts:

System for reminding users of upcoming payments (24-48 hours in advance).
